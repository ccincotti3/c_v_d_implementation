# Final Project Pt. 4: Presentation

## Overview

Present your findings to your classmates as if they were an audience of non-technical executive stakeholders.

## Deliverables

Present your project in a way that would make it compelling to a business stakeholder.

Your presentation should include...
   - A problem statement.
   - Metrics and assumptions.
   - Approach and process.
   - Your model or solution.
   - Performance evaluation (ideally expressed in terms of business outcomes).
   - Impact of your findings.
   - Recommendations or next steps.

It should **not** include terms such as mean-squared error or visuals such as a correlation heatmap that a nontechnical audience would not understand.

Be prepared to explain and defend your model to an inquisitive audience.

You will have something like 5-10 minutes to present, depending on how many students submit a final project. Exact timing guidelines for your cohort will be posted below a couple weeks ahead of time.
 
<!--DATR-618: Aim for **6-8 minutes**. There will be a **hard cutoff** at **9 minutes**. I want to reward preparing against these expectations, so these times **will not change** even if we have fewer presenters than we are anticipating at this point.-->

Submit any supporting materials for your project, such as slides or a Jupyter notebook, following the instructions in the Course Info doc.

## Tips

Put the bottom line up front (e.g. a description of the value that your model can provide and a brief statement of any important insights you gained along the way), and then back it up with supporting information.

Use slides and/or a Jupyter notebook as a visual aid. Include lots of visuals, and keep text short.

## Stretch Challenges

For a stretch challenge, you might create an interactive demo of your model in action, explain how you would deploy your model in a production environment, or discuss how to evaluate your solution's performance over time.

## Examples

You can see an example of a past presentation [here](./presentation_example.pdf) and additional examples at the [GA Gallery](https://gallery.generalassemb.ly/DS?metro=), but note that the GA Gallery examples in particular may have been based on somewhat different instructions.
